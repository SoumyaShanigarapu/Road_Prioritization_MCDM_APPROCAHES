#ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT
Pavements are crucial for a country's economic and industrial growth, and their maintenance is just as important as their construction. Over time, various factors such as vehicular stress, exposure to sunlight, water intrusion, and seasonal changes can cause pavement deterioration, which is not only costly to repair but also time-consuming. To address this issue, an algorithm that can take into account multiple factors and make informed decisions is required. The study aimed to develop a user-friendly and flexible algorithm that can handle large amounts of pavement data and provide prioritization ranks for roads. The study used 21 1km road stretches in Ibrahim Bagh, Alijapur, Neknampur, Mahalneknampur, and Jai hind colony and integrated three Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, namely Fuzzy TOPSIS, AHP, and Concordance, using Python programming language. The methods were given equal weightages, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the results. The algorithms produced stretch-wise prioritization ranks, which were imported into GIS to generate thematic maps for various factors considered. According to the results, Stretch 5 should be given the highest priority, followed by Stretch 12. The results obtained from all three methods were almost equal
